# Fetch Backend Internship Challenge

The above implementation was carried out as a part of the backend internship challenge put forth by Fetch.
I had a lot of fun in implementing this :P

Install Eclipse and use File->Import->Git->Projects from Git to clone this repo.
Build the project and run the UserRewardsApplication.java file as a Java Application

The service (backend code) would be up and running at localhost:8000
To test the functionality make the call to localhost:8000/add , localhost:8000/spendPoints, localhost:8000/balance a needed.

Reach out to me for any clarifications!
